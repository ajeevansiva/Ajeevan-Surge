The Assesment

An Web Application created using the MERN Stack where an admin creates the account for the user with temporary password and send it with a login link to the email of that user. When the user logins if it is his first time he gets the option to fill their user information and change their password and then has to login again with new password. If the user that has logged in is an admin they can view the user list and the user details. If the user that has logged in is a student then they can view their notes list and can create new notes, update their notes and delete their notes.
